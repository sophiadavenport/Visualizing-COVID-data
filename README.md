# Visualizing-COVID-data

This notebook aims to visualize current cases of COVID-19 using data provided by: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus . This example uses the date of September 30th, 2023 and gives a chart of new COVID cases per country (with 6 randomly chosen countries displayed). It also calculates the new cases per million by country for two dates and creates a global heatmap for each. The purpose of this exercise is to work with pandas dataframes and use both matplotlib and geopandas to visualize results.
